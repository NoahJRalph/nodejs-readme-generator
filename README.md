## Description

My very own simple ReadMe generator. Made using the criteria from Module 9 of my edX Web Development bootcamp. This ReadMe was generated using the ReadMe Generator!

## Installation

Simply download the index.js file, then run the file (ideally inside it's own folder) with an installed instance of Node.

## Usage

From either Git Bash or a command window, from the directory that the index.js file is downloaded and located inside, install Node via command "npm i", then run the command "node index.js" to run the readme generator.

## Demonstration

## Contribution Guidelines

I'm not seeking contributions at this time.

## Test Instructions

Merely run the nodejs file via the command "node index.js".
